    "This assignment asked to solve the 0-1 knapsack problem. It is a classic optimization problem where you are given a set of items, each with a specific weight and a value. The goal is to determine the maximum value that can be obtained by selecting a subset of the items in such a way that the sum of the selected items' weights does not exceed a given capacity.\n",
    "\n",
    "The problem is NP-hard, meaning that as the number of items increases, the number of possible combinations grows exponentially, making it computationally infeasible to accurately find the best solution for large instances. Therefore, algorithms, such as greedy algorithms, simulated annealing and genetic algorithms, are used to *approximate* solutions to this problem efficiently, which is the main objective of this assignment."

    "Based on the diagram, higher the cooling rate is, higher the accurary we can get. because the cooling rate affects both temperature change and probaility of evaluating acceptance. However, we can see that the overall improvment is not really high. High value of cooling rate can increase 10% of the accuraries.\n",
    "Then, I changed the variable N which is the number of iteration and keep the cooling_rate as 0.95. From the diagram, the larger N is , the higher accuracy that algorithm can reach. The high value of N means that the function has more chances to explore different ways. The overall accuracy is high under a constant high value of cooling rate. When the N value is low, the accurary is also very low down to 40%.\n",
    "In addition, I also test the accuracies under different initial_temperature. The temperature will affect the probability of acceptance, and when the temperature is high, the higher chance that the algothrim will keep the worse solution occurs. According to the diagrams below, the temperature did not significantly improve the result accuracy as same as the cooling rate.\n",
    "\n",
    "The results of Simulated Annealing algothrim under best conditions is about 0.98 which is really close to the best solutions. It has reached the expectation of implementation.\n",

    "Genetic algorithms are a popular optimization technique inspired by the principles of natural evolution. They explore a wide range of potential solution and operate on a population of solutions simultaneously, allowing parallel exploration of different regions of the solution space. This parallelism not only enable faster search in the solution space, but also helps in avoiding local optima by maintaining a diverse population. When solving the 0-1 knapsack problem, the algorithm can be described in following steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Initialization\n",
    "    * The algorithm starts by creating a population of individuals, where each individual represents a possible solution to the knapsack problem.\n",

    "    * The fitness of each individual is calculated based on the total price of the items included in the knapsack.\n",

    "**9. Conclusion**\n",
    "\n",
    "In this study, we investigated and compared four distinct search algorithms aimed at solving the classic 0-1 knapsack problem: generate-and-test (brute-force search), greedy search, simulated annealing, and genetic algorithms.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our experiments revealed that there is no universal solution for the knapsack problem. Generate-and-test, although exhaustive, becomes unfeasible for larger problem instances due to its exponential time complexity. Greedy search produced rapid but often suboptimal outcomes. Simulated annealing and genetic algorithms, after careful parameter adjustments, exhibited competitive performance by effectively balancing exploration and exploitation.\n",
    "Simulated annealing's effectiveness heavily depended on the initial temperature, iteration count, and cooling factor. A higher initial temperature encouraged broader exploration, while a lower temperature emphasized exploitation. The genetic algorithm's performance was influenced by the crossover and mutation rates, where a balanced approach ensured diverse exploration while converging towards the optimal solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, our empirical investigation offered a comprehensive insight into the behavior of each algorithm across diverse conditions. Despite its simplicity, generate-and-test highlighted the brute-force nature of exhaustive search, exploring all possible solutions. In contrast, greedy search demonstrated the efficiency of making locally optimal choices at each step. Simulated annealing showcased the power of probabilistic optimization, exploring the solution space based on acceptance probabilities and adapting to different initial temperatures, iteration counts, and cooling factors. The genetic algorithm, with its evolutionary approach, underscored the significance of balanced crossover and mutation rates in exploring and exploiting the solution space."
